# Week 6 - Frontend Project - Plateful of Pleasure

A front-end only app allowing users to input an ingredient and recieve a number of meal ideas using that ingredient.

### Motivation

For this project we had to use an api of our choice to make an app of our choice. We collectively decided on a recipe app and read into the api, which allowed requests based on an ingredient.

### Lessons learned

- How to fetch from an api using variables
- Mapping data onto a component.

### Tech Stack

- React
- Javascript
- CSS

### Improvements

If we had time, we would have added a second fetch, if a particular meal was clicked, to the open another page or popup revealing the full recipe. Similarly, I would have improved the colour scheme, and the styling too, making it a little more slick and thematic.

### Usage
1. Follow [this link]().
2. Enter an ingredient, please make sure the spelling is accurate.
3. Scroll through and see what meals you can make.
